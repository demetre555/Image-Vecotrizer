Image Processing: Loads images, converts them to grayscale, applies Gaussian blur, and performs edge detection using Canny.
Shape Detection: Detects basic shapes such as triangles, rectangles, squares, and circles.
Line Detection: Identifies lines in images using the Hough Transform.
PDF Export: Exports the processed image with detected shapes and lines to a PDF.
Visualization: Displays the detected edges, shapes, and final image using OpenCV windows.
